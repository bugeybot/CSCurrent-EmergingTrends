# CSCurrent-EmergingTrends

## Project Summary
This project focused on developing a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning techniques. The goal was to create a functional agent capable of making optimal decisions in a simulated environment, showcasing concepts such as neural networks and reinforcement learning. The project began with starter code that provided a basic framework for the environment and agent. From there, I developed the core reinforcement learning algorithms, optimized the agent’s performance, and integrated neural network models to enhance its decision-making capabilities.

## Connecting Learning to Computer Science
Throughout this course, I deepened my understanding of how reinforcement learning and neural networks can solve complex real-world problems. Computer scientists design and implement systems that process data, make decisions, and automate tasks, fundamentally driving innovation across industries. This matters because their work enables solutions that improve efficiency, solve critical problems, and shape the future of technology.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks, applying structured problem-solving techniques, and iterating on solutions based on testing and feedback. For this project, that meant analyzing the pirate agent’s environment, defining rewards and penalties, and systematically improving its learning strategy.

Ethical considerations are integral to computer science. For reinforcement learning, it’s essential to ensure fairness in training datasets, transparency in decision-making, and accountability for potential unintended consequences. My responsibility lies in developing systems that are not only functional but also ethical and aligned with user and organizational values.
